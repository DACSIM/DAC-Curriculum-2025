Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model is trained on a dataset to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions without human intervention.\n","\n","**A general pipeline:** \\\n","1.) Data Collection - Collecting data relevant to the problem you want to solve. \\\n","2.) Training  - Using this dataset to train a model, which involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize errors in its predictions. \\\n","3.) Evaluation - Testing the model on new, unseen data to evaluate its performance. \\\n","4.) Prediction + Deployment - Using the trained model to make predictions or decisions on new data, and deploying it so that other users may use it as well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D-rE1YZPUb2j"},"source":["# 1 - Linear Regression"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"McIUgeETUb2j"},"source":["## Univariate (Simple) Linear Regression"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yr2ir1GhUb2k"},"source":["Univariate linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable $x$ and a dependent variable $y$ by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
